        <h5>OUR STRATEGIC APPROACH</h5>

        <p>At FortOilStorage, we invest strategically in expanding our storage and handling capabilities, not only for petroleum products but also for agri and mineral liquids, alongside processing activities within our liquid bulk portfolio. Our growth is supported through greenfield developments, acquisitions of operational terminals, and enhancements at our existing locations in Singapore, the Netherlands, Fujairah, and Houston.</p>

        <p>We actively pursue sustainable growth opportunities, focusing on energy transition initiatives such as hydrogen, chemical recycling, and chilled gases, while exploring adjacent commercial potential. By innovating responsibly, we ensure that our operations remain aligned with the evolving global energy landscape.</p>

        <p>Our commitment extends to all stakeholders â€” employees, clients, shareholders, and the communities where we operate. Guided by our core values of safety, honesty, respect, accountability, transparency, and entrepreneurialism, FortOilStorage fosters long-term growth and creates meaningful value in every market we serve.</p>
