                <h2>Tank Storage Fascility</h2>

                <p>FortOilStorage manages independently operated tank farms in <strong>Singapore, the Netherlands, Fujairah, and Houston,</strong> providing reliable storage and logistics services for a wide range of petroleum and petrochemical products. Unlike facilities tied to specific oil companies, our terminals are independently managed, enabling us to serve multiple clients while maintaining transparency and efficiency in storage and handling operations.</p>

                <p>Our tank farms are designed with both above-ground and underground storage systems, supported by advanced infrastructure that ensures the safe and efficient discharge of products into pipelines, rail systems, barges, and heavy-duty oil tankers. With a combined storage capacity of nearly <strong>30 million cubic meters,</strong> our strategically located terminals allow us to meet global demand while ensuring smooth product distribution across international trade routes.</p>

                <p>Positioned at key energy hubs, FortOilStorage terminals enable direct access for ocean vessels to discharge cargo, while integrated pipeline and transport connections ensure seamless onward delivery to refineries, petrol stations, and industrial end users. This combination of scale, flexibility, and strategic placement makes FortOilStorage a trusted partner for global energy storage and logistics.</p>
